# ðŸŒ¸ Blossom 

**This project is a work in progress.**

## Description
Blossom is a library mod, mainly for personal use, which allows you to group items by identifier. For example a block `yourmod:yourblock` and block entity `yourmod:yourblock` would be grouped into one [BGroup](src/main/java/com/hazeltrinity/blossom/init/BGroup.java). Make sure you only use one instance of [BMod](src/main/java/com/hazeltrinity/blossom/BMod.java) in your mod, and inherit from [BModInitializer](src/main/java/com/hazeltrinity/blossom/init/BModInitializer.java) for your entrypoints.

Further it allows you to make custom GUIs, similar to [LibGui](https://github.com/CottonMC/LibGui), with the main draw to Blossom being, in the future having "Styles" similar to css to customize your entire GUI at runtime easily.
